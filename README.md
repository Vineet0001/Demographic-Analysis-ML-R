# 🎯 Predictive Demographic Analysis using R

This project explores predictive analytics on demographic traits like hair color, eye color, and sex using the `HairEyeColor` dataset. It applies multiple machine learning models to classify and predict eye color and analyze attribute frequency using regression and clustering techniques.

## 📁 Dataset

The built-in R dataset `HairEyeColor` is used and transformed into a data frame.

## 🔧 Models Implemented

### 📌 Decision Tree
``r
accuracy_dt <- mean(predictions_dt == test$Eye)
# Accuracy: ~12.5%

## 🔧 Output SS
